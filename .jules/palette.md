## 2026-06-25 - [Widget Accessibility & iOS 17 Rendering]
**Learning:** Widgets in iOS 17+ require the `.containerBackground` modifier for correct rendering. Additionally, for small-format widgets, using `.accessibilityElement(children: .combine)` creates a much smoother VoiceOver experience by summarizing the widget's state in a single announcement rather than forcing the user to navigate individual elements in a tiny space.
**Action:** Always combine accessibility elements in simple widgets and ensure iOS 17+ container background compliance.
